/*Lawn Mowing: Write a program for a lawn-mowing service. The lawn-mowing season lasts 20 weeks. The weekly fee for mowing a lot less 
than 400 square feet is $20. The fee for a lot 400 square feet or more but less than 600 square feet is $25 per week. The fee for a 
lot 600 square feet or over is $35 per week. To pay the bill, the customer can pay once, twice, or 20 times per year. If the user 
requests once payment, the fee for the season is simply the seasonal total. If the customer requests two payments, each payment 
is half the seasonal fee plus a $5 service charge. */
